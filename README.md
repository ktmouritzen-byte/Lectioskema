# Lectio “Advanced Schedule” HTML → iCal (.ics) Feed

A small daily sync tool that:
1) reads a **Lectio “Avanceret skema / Advanced Schedule” HTML** file, and
2) converts every schedule entry into a **valid iCalendar (.ics)** file.

You then **host the `.ics` on GitHub Pages** and subscribe to it from Apple Calendar.

This README is the living spec for what we build in this conversation.

---

## Goal
- **Input**: A local Lectio HTML file (the “print” / “advanced schedule” view).
- **Output**: A single `.ics` file containing all events.
- **Hosting**: Publish the `.ics` via GitHub Pages.
- **Apple Calendar**: Subscribe to the GitHub Pages URL (auto-updates).
- **Run cadence**: Regenerate daily at **08:00 Europe/Copenhagen**.
- **Idempotent**: Stable `UID` per event so changes overwrite old entries.

Non-goals (unless you ask):
- Building a UI
- Automating Lectio login / scraping behind 2FA
- Writing directly into iCloud via CalDAV (subscription feed is simpler)

---

## How the sync works (Apple Calendar)
Apple Calendar can subscribe to an online `.ics` feed (read-only). When the `.ics` changes, Apple Calendar updates.

This project generates the `.ics` file and publishes it on GitHub Pages.

Notes:
- Apple Calendar subscription refresh is controlled by Apple and may lag (minutes to hours).
- This repo can fetch Lectio HTML automatically only if you provide a valid logged-in session cookie (MitID login itself is not automated).

---

## Tech choice
### Language
- **Python 3.11+**

### Key libraries
- `beautifulsoup4` + `lxml` (HTML parsing)
- `python-dateutil` (timezone helpers)

We will implement iCalendar writing ourselves to meet the strict RFC5545 escaping and line-folding requirements.

## Project structure (planned)
We’ll add these files as we implement:

- `src/lectio_sync/__init__.py`
- `src/lectio_sync/html_parser.py` (Lectio HTML → events)
- `src/lectio_sync/event_model.py` (dataclass for an event)
- `src/lectio_sync/cli.py` (HTML → ICS command line tool)
- `requirements.txt`
 - `docs/calendar.ics` (output for GitHub Pages)
 - `.github/workflows/update-calendar.yml` (scheduled build)

Optional later:
- `tests/` (if you want automated tests)

---

## Configuration
We will support configuration via environment variables (and optionally a `.env` file).

Planned variables:
- `LECTIO_HTML_PATH` — full path to the Lectio HTML file
- `LECTIO_TIMEZONE` — default: `Europe/Copenhagen`
Optional filtering:
- `SYNC_DAYS_PAST` — include events starting from N days back (default: 7)
- `SYNC_DAYS_FUTURE` — include events up to N days forward (default: 90)
- `DELETE_MISSING` — default: `true`. Current implementation regenerates a full feed each run, so missing items are naturally removed.
- `EMIT_CANCELLED_EVENTS` — default: `false`. If `true`, cancelled entries are emitted as `STATUS:CANCELLED` instead of being dropped.

CLI overrides:
- `--days-past N`
- `--days-future N`
- `--delete-missing` / `--keep-missing` (compatibility flag; feed is still fully regenerated)
- `--emit-cancelled-events`
- `--debug` (prints parser stats plus window filter before/after counts)

## Environment

- This project does not create or manage Python virtual environments automatically. Do NOT run `python -m venv`, `py -m venv`, `virtualenv`, `conda create`, `pipenv`, or `poetry env` as part of development or automation in this repository. Assume you will use your preferred Python interpreter or activation method outside of this repo. Guidance for contributors and automation lives in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `scripts/bootstrap.ps1`.

## Lectio parsing and iCal rules (MUST FOLLOW)
This section is the authoritative parsing spec.

### 1) Locate the schedule table
All schedule data is contained in:
```html
<table id="m_Content_SkemaMedNavigation_skema_skematabel">
  ...
  <td data-date="YYYY-MM-DD">...</td>
</table>
```

Parser selection strategy:
- First try exact table id: `m_Content_SkemaMedNavigation_skema_skematabel`
- Fallback: first `<table>` that contains both `td[data-date]` and `a.s2skemabrik`

### 2) Locate date cells
Each day column is identified by:

```html
<td data-date="YYYY-MM-DD">
```

### 3) Identify all activities (schedule bricks)
Each activity is represented by:

```html
<a class="s2skemabrik ...">
```

Only these `<a>` elements represent real events.

Ignore all other elements in the same container, including:
- `<div class="s2module-bg">`
- `<div class="s2module-info">`
- decorative elements / time markers / layout backgrounds

For each activity, extract:
- the `data-tooltip` attribute (primary and most detailed data source)
- the content from `<div class="s2skemabrikcontent">` (fallback for title/room/etc.)

### 4) Text normalization (before parsing)
- trim whitespace (start/end)
- convert `\r\n` → `\n`
- remove duplicate blank lines
- remove leading `- ` from list items
- preserve category headers like `Homework:`, `Note:`, `Additional info:`
- remove any HTML tags if present
- normalize unicode (retain bullets like `•` if possible)

### 5) Tooltip extraction rules
Tooltip text contains several lines; format varies.

#### 5.1 Title
- The first meaningful line is the event title.
- If the first line is `Ændret!` or `Changed!`, ignore it and use the next line.
- If the first meaningful line matches the date/time pattern, the title is missing → use `.s2skemabrikcontent` text as title.

#### 5.2 Date and time
Look for a line matching:
- `DD/MM-YYYY HH:MM til HH:MM`
- `DD/MM-YYYY Hele dagen` / `DD/MM-YYYY All day`

Convert date `DD/MM-YYYY` → `YYYY-MM-DD`.

#### 5.3 All day events
If the line contains `Hele dagen` or `All day`:
- Use all-day iCal formatting:
  - `DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:YYYYMMDD`
  - `DTEND;VALUE=DATE:YYYYMMDD`
- `DTEND` must be the **same** date (do not add one day).

#### 5.4 Class/Group
Lines beginning with `Hold:` contain one or multiple class names.

#### 5.5 Teacher(s)
Lines starting with `Lærer:` / `Lærere:` may contain multiple teachers separated by commas.

#### 5.6 Room
Line starting with `Lokale:` contains the room (e.g. `2.03`, `X DVR`).

#### 5.7 Notes, homework, additional info
Everything after the `Lokale:` line belongs in `DESCRIPTION`.
Keep it exactly as written, including section headers.

### 6) Ignore the HTML layout
Do not use box heights / pixel positions / module background blocks / graphic separators.
Start/end time must come **solely** from tooltip text.

### 7) iCal UID and DTSTAMP
For stable identity:
- If `data-brikid="ABS123..."` exists → `UID` must be `ABS123@lectio.dk`
- Otherwise generate a stable hash from `(tooltip + date)`

`DTSTAMP` is the generation timestamp.

### 8) iCal escaping and line folding (RFC5545)
- Max line length: 75 characters
- Fold with: newline + single space (`\n `)
- Use `\n` for line breaks inside `DESCRIPTION`
- Keep commas and colons unescaped unless required by iCal standard
- `SUMMARY` and `LOCATION` are single-line (fold if needed)

### 9) VEVENT structure
Each event must be:

```
BEGIN:VEVENT
UID:<unique-id>
DTSTAMP:<timestamp>
SUMMARY:<title>
DTSTART:<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS>    or DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:YYYYMMDD
DTEND:<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS>      or DTEND;VALUE=DATE:YYYYMMDD
LOCATION:<room>
DESCRIPTION:<full tooltip text, including notes and categories>
END:VEVENT
```

### 10) VCALENDAR structure

```
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
VERSION:2.0
PRODID:-//LectioParser//Custom//EN
...events...
END:VCALENDAR
```

### Domain rules
- The schedule should include **subject + teacher + room** in title when available.
- Notes + homework must be included.
- Cancelled lessons must be removed.
- Changes should overwrite old schedule entries (achieved via stable `UID`).

---

## Timezone
- Default timezone: `Europe/Copenhagen`.
- Timed events will be written as local floating times (no `Z`) unless you ask to include `VTIMEZONE`.

---

## Running daily at 08:00
You have two realistic options:

### Option A: Run locally (recommended when HTML is local)
Use Windows Task Scheduler to run the CLI at 08:00.

This repo includes helper scripts:
- `scripts/update_ics.ps1` (generate `docs/calendar.ics`)
- `scripts/update_ics_and_push.ps1` (generate + `git commit` + `git push`)

### Option B: GitHub Actions (only if the HTML is in the repo)
GitHub Actions cannot log into Lectio with 2FA, so it can only regenerate the `.ics` automatically if the input HTML is already committed or otherwise available without login.

Important:
- For fully automatic updates without a computer running, use GitHub Actions + the `--fetch` mode (cookie-based).
- If you keep HTML local only, disable the scheduled workflow and use Task Scheduler + `scripts/update_ics_and_push.ps1`.
- Fully automatic fetch requires a valid Lectio session cookie stored as a GitHub Secret. Review privacy/security implications.

## What I need from you to build this
Please answer these. Once I have them, I can implement the program end-to-end.

### 1) The Lectio HTML format
- Provide **one real sample HTML file** (or paste a representative snippet) that includes:
  - at least 2–3 different event types (normal classes, cancellations, homework/notes if present)
  - at least one event with a room/teacher if that exists
- Tell me **how you get/export** this HTML:
  - is it “print/save as HTML”, “save page”, or a built-in export?
  - does it update automatically, or do you download it each day?

### 2) Date/time rules
- What timezone should we use? (likely `Europe/Copenhagen`, but confirm)
- Are there repeating events or week schedules?
- Can the HTML contain:
  - cancellations
  - moved lessons
  - substitutions
  - multiple entries with the same title/time

### 3) Apple Calendar destination
- Do you want events written to:
  - an existing iCloud calendar (name?)
  - or should the tool create a new calendar called `Lectio`?

### 4) iCloud / CalDAV access
- Confirm you use iCloud (Apple Calendar synced via iCloud).
- Confirm you can create an **app-specific password** for CalDAV.
- If you already know it: what is your CalDAV server URL?
  - If not, I’ll guide you to find it safely.

### 5) Sync policy
- How far ahead should we sync? (e.g. 60–120 days)
- Should we delete events that disappear from Lectio? (`DELETE_MISSING=true/false`)
- Should we update event titles/locations if they change? (usually yes)

### 6) Matching rules / event identity
If Lectio does not provide a stable unique ID per event in the HTML:
- Is it acceptable to treat (title + start time + end time) as identity?
- Or do you want additional fields included (room/teacher)?

### 7) Where it runs
- Will this run on the same Windows machine every day?
- Do you prefer it to run “headless” (no prompts) once configured?

---

## Publish on GitHub Pages
We will write the output to `docs/calendar.ics`. Configure GitHub Pages to serve from the `docs/` folder.

Apple Calendar subscription URL will be:
- `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/calendar.ics`

In Apple Calendar:
- File → New Calendar Subscription…
- Paste the URL (or `webcal://...` equivalent)
- Set auto-refresh to a reasonable interval.

Tip: Apple Calendar subscriptions are read-only. This is expected.

---

## Next step
Reply with:
1) a sample Lectio HTML file (upload it into this workspace, best), and
2) how we should detect cancellations in the tooltip (exact wording you see),
3) whether you want to include a `VTIMEZONE` block or keep “floating” local times.

After that, I’ll implement the parser + `.ics` generator and add a GitHub Pages-ready output.
